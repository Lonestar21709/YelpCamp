#YelpCamp

## Introduction

This application allows users to share their campsite experiences and collaborate with one another through comments. The application uses the seven types of RESTFUL routes in order to display a list of campsites and comments, create a new campsite or comment, show more info about a particular campsite, edit campsite information or comment content, and delete campsites as well as comments. In order to collaborate on the application you need to be logged in, or sign up, and be authenticated. Only the user who posts a campsite can edit and delete it. Same goes for comments that users post. The application makes use of Express.js to build the backend server and mongoDB as the database to store campsite, comment, and user data.
